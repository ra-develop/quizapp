# About the project

Welcome to the final project for this Spring Framework Fundamentals course. In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills you learned in this course to a simulated scenario.

In this project, you will create a secure Quiz Application using Spring framework incorporating Spring Web, Thymeleaf, and Spring Security as dependencies.

This final project includes 11 tasks and will take about 60 minutes to complete. One you have completed the project, you will be asked to answer questions based on the project.

You are currently viewing this lab in a Cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (Cloud IDE). This fully-online environment comes preinstalled with JDK 21, allowing you to code, develop, and learn in one location.
